\chapter{Introduction}


\gls{NLP}NLP techniques are widely used in applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition. For example, the transformer model introduced by has revolutionized the field of machine translation by achieving state-of-the-art performance on various language pairs\citep{zhang2014research}.
\gls{ML} is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data. These algorithms can be used to make predictions, classify data, and optimize processes. For example, deep learning models have been used to achieve human-level performance on tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.
